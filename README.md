# go-nlp

## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be
unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your
project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see
GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew.
However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing
specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a
specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be
installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of
usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably
include in the README.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address,
etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started.
Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps
explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce
the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially
helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
